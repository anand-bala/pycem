# Cross-Entropy Method for Optimization

A [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)-based implementation for the [Cross-Entropy
Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-entropy_method) for optimization.
This tool primarily implements CEM for optimization in continuous spaces with
Gaussian sampling.

The design of this optimizer is inspired by `ask` and `tell` interface of
[pycma](https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma).

(Note: This was ported from another private project I have, but I thought it
made sense to have this out in the public.)
